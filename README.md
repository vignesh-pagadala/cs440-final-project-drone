# Self-Stabilizing Quadcopter Drones using Neural Networks

In this project, I used Unity3D to simulate a drone which attempts to self-stabilize or hover without crashing, and learns to do this by itself. The 'learning' process is accomplished with the use of neural networks, implemented in Python. The drone attempts to make its way to an LZ, and eventually make a safe landing.

To view the simulation gifs through the browser, use Jupyter Notebook. This project was done as a part of the CS440:Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course, during the Fall of 2017 at Colorado State University. The course instructor was Dr. Charles Anderson.
