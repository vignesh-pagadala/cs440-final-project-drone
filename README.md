# Self-Stabilizing Quadcopter Drones using Neural Networks
## By Vignesh M. Pagadala
In this project, I used Unity3D to simulate a drone which attempts to self-stabilize or hover without crashing, and learns to do this by itself. The 'learning' process is accomplished with the use of neural networks, implemented in Python.

This project was done to satisfy the course requirements for the course <strong>CS440:Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</strong> during the Fall of 2017, taught by Dr. Charles Anderson at Colorado State University.
